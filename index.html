<h1>Akan Name Generator</h1>
   <div id="akan-name"></div>
    <p>In this project, using a simple web application that calculates the day of the week a user was born and assigns them an Akan name based on their gender.
       Akan names come from Ghanaian culture, where children are named based on the day they were born.
       We shall start by familiarizing ourselves with Akan names that have been included in the project </p>
